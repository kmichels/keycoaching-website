            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>With over 25 years in Tech, and over 12 years of experience as a tech professional at a FAANG company, I've witnessed firsthand the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the tech industry. I've been through the highs of rapid growth and innovation, and I've navigated the challenges of restructuring and market shifts.</p>
            <p>This journey has given me a unique perspective on what it takes to build a resilient and fulfilling tech career. It's this experience that fuels my passion for coaching and drives me to help others unlock their full potential in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

            <h3>Why I Started Key Coaching</h3>
            <p>In my years in the tech industry, I saw too many talented professionals struggle with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unexpected career transitions and layoffs</li>
                <li>Feeling stuck or undervalued in their current roles</li>
                <li>Navigating toxic work environments</li>
                <li>Uncertainty about how to advance their careers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I realized that my experience and insights could help bridge the gap between where tech professionals are and where they want to be. That's why I founded Key Coaching - to provide the guidance, strategies, and support that I wish I had earlier in my career.</p>
