                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>With 30 years in Tech, and over 12 years of experience at Meta (Facebook), I've witnessed firsthand the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the tech industry. I was the first technical hire outside the US at Facebook, starting in London in 2008 and building out the European SRE presence from scratch.</p>
                <p>I've held multiple roles - Lead SRE, Manager, Production Engineering, TPM, and Product Manager. I've led major initiatives like Project Sandstorm (the first-ever planned datacenter shutdown without user impact), managed cache infrastructure serving tens of billions of requests per second, and built enterprise video conferencing systems.</p>
                <p>This journey has given me a unique perspective on what it takes to build a resilient and fulfilling tech career. It's this experience that fuels my passion for coaching and drives me to help others unlock their full potential.</p>

                <h2>Why I Started Key Coaching</h2>
                <p>In my years in the tech industry, I saw too many talented professionals struggle with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unexpected career transitions and layoffs</li>
                    <li>Feeling stuck or undervalued in their current roles</li>
                    <li>Navigating toxic work environments</li>
                    <li>Uncertainty about how to advance their careers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I realized that my experience and insights could help bridge the gap between where tech professionals are and where they want to be. That's why I founded Key Coaching - to provide the guidance, strategies, and support that I wish I had earlier in my career.</p>
