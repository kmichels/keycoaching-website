                            <p>An Income Share Agreement is a flexible payment option I offer, designed to align my success with yours.

My Career Accelerator ISA package includes up to 4.5 hours of coaching per month for 6 months, with no upfront cost. You only begin payments as a percentage of your new salary for a fixed period once you're employed, and I cap the total amount paid to ensure fairness. Full terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, are available upon request.</p>
