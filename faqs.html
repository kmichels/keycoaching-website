                            <summary><h3>How long does the coaching process typically last?</h3></summary>
                            <p>My coaching engagements are flexible and tailored to your specific needs and goals. I offer a range of options, from single-session consultations for specific issues to longer-term engagements for comprehensive career development. My short-term packages, like the 4-session Career Transition Jumpstart, are ideal for focused, immediate needs. For those looking for more extensive support, I offer longer-term engagements such as our 4.5 hours/month Comprehensive Career Makeover package. I also provide ongoing monthly support for continuous career guidance. Typically, I recommend starting with a 3-month engagement to establish momentum and see significant progress.</p>

                            <summary><h3>What is an Income Share Agreement (ISA), and how does it work?</h3></summary>
                            <p>An Income Share Agreement is a flexible payment option I offer, designed to align my success with yours. Under this agreement, you pay for coaching services as a percentage of your income once you secure a job, rather than paying upfront fees. My Career Accelerator ISA package includes up to 4.5 hours of coaching per month for 6 months, with no upfront cost. You only begin payments as a percentage of your new salary for a fixed period once you're employed, and I cap the total amount paid to ensure fairness. Full terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, are available upon request.</p>

                            <p>Tech career coaching can be beneficial at various stages of your career. You might find it particularly valuable if you're feeling stuck or unsatisfied in your current role, facing a career transition or unexpected layoff, or aspiring to advance to a leadership position in tech. It's also highly beneficial if you're looking to pivot to a different area within the tech industry, need help optimizing your job search in a competitive market, or are early in your tech career and want to establish a strong foundation. If you're unsure, I offer an initial consultation to discuss your situation and determine if coaching is the right step for you.</p>
