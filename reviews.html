                        <p class="review-content">"I had the pleasure of working with Konrad for several months as I looked to rebuild my resume and find a new job. From our very first session, Konrad demonstrated an exceptional level of expertise, empathy, and dedication to helping me achieve my career goals. Konrad understands the challenging job market, what hiring managers are looking for and how to communicate experience and skills properly in the elevator pitch that is a resume. I highly recommend working with him to help with understanding how to put your best foot forward and get the traction needed to move forward in your career goals."</p>

                        <p class="review-content">"Konrad was my manager at Facebook (now Meta) for 3 years - years which became formative to my career. His attitude and support enabled me to find my place in a team of accomplished people, overcome my imposter syndrome and have impact. He identified talents that led me into a tech-lead role and later inspired me to become an engineering manager. Ten years later, I've created and grown eight teams in three tech companies, and I always strive to employ the same attitude and care that Konrad gave with me."</p>

                        <p class="review-content">"I want to say a big thank you to Konrad who saw potential and took a chance on me to in what turned out to be the best job of my life. I always enjoyed working with Konrad, he was easy to talk to, and his sense of humour put everyone at ease and ensured that work was always fun yet focused. Konrad leads from the front, he would stay hands on technically enough to show new hires like myself how things are done. He embodied the 'move fast' mantra. I think anyone would learn from working with Konrad."</p>
